# Webservices API Endpoints

This page lists the endpoints available in Joomla.

<details>
  <summary>To know</summary>
  <div>
    <h3>Authentication Required</h3>
    <p>Every endpoint requires authentication unless is designated as public. For security in Joomla 4, we make the default API Application require a Super User account because the API Application is brand new. This of course, may get relaxed as the API stabilizes and is well tested in the community.</p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <h3>Authentication Types</h3>
    <p>Two types of authentication plugins are currently supported:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>API Authentication - Web Services Basic Auth plugin:</strong> Using user credentials and password. <em>This is not the recommended one to use, so we will not consume the API using this method</em>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>API Authentication - Web Services Joomla Token plugin:</strong> A more secure token authentication using a Bearer token. In this case you need active too the plugin <em>User - Joomla API Token</em>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A detailed explanation about why one is more secure than the other, can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/pull/27021" target="_blanck">pull request</a>.</p>

## Endpoints

:::info URL path

Every URL needs to be prepended with the Joomla host before the path (e.g. instead of `/api/index.php/v1/article` you need `https://example.com/api/index.php/v1/article`)

:::

:::info URL properties

Any names of properties in curly brackets {} indicate the property is a variable that should be substituted.
